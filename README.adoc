== Description

This project aims to be a sandbox for developers testing https://github.com/fewlinesco/bamboo_smtp[BambooSMTP].

== Installation

Once you cloned this project, heads up to `mix.exs` to set the desired version of BambooSMTP.

[source, elixir]
----
# By default, we target the current release.
defp deps do
  [{:bamboo_smtp, "~> 3.0"}]
end

# You might want to target a local version on your computer.
defp deps do
  [{:bamboo_smtp, path: "../path/to/bamboo_smtp"}]
end
----

You will need to set some values as environment variables.

[source, bash]
----
# Create a new file for env vars (based on our sample).
cp .env_vars.sample .env_vars
----

Then, set the following values in `.env_vars`:

- `EMAIL_TO`: The email address you want to send an email.
- `EMAIL_FROM`: The email address that will send the email.

You will find the SMTP configuration options below those values.

=== Help! I know nothing about SMTP server configuration! 😱

If you owns a Google account (and so a Gmail address), you can use Google's SMTP server.

Set the following values:

- `SMTP_SERVER`: 'smtp.gmail.com'
- `SMTP_HOSTNAME`: '[YOU CAN PUT ANYTHING HERE]'
- `SMTP_PORT`: '465'
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: '[YOUR GMAIL ADDRESS]'
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: '[YOUR GMAIL PASSWORD]'

⚠️ **Don't forget two things**:

- You should allow https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en[IMAP transfert in your account settings].
- If you have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication[2FA] activated on your Google account: you should manually https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en[create an application password] and use it as `SMTP_PASSWORD`.

== Usage

The application is intended to be used through `iex`.

[source, bash]
----
iex -S mix
----

Once inside `iex`, you will have access to some functions such as:

[source, elixir]
----
# Send a basic email with some default values as subject and text body.
BambooSMTPSandbox.Sender.send_email()

# Send a basic email like above but with some attachments.
BambooSMTPSandbox.Sender.send_email_with_attachments()
----

I wish you a good testing. 😌
